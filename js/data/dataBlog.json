A shell & core space offers flexibility and lower upfront costs, allowing you to design every detail according to your needs.

It reduces stress and shortens timelines but may limit customization options and increase the initial price.</p> <p>In this article, we compare both approaches in terms of cost, timeline, resale value, and investment strategy. Whether you are buying for personal use, rental income, or resale, understanding the pros and cons of each option will help you make a decision aligned with your financial goals and long-term plans.</p>"
